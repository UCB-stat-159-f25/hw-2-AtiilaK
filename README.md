# HW 2: From Notebooks to Research Packages

This repository contains my HW2 submission for STAT 159/259: From Notebooks to Research Packages. It reproduces the LIGO gravitational-wave analysis for the GW150914 event using open data from the LIGO Open Science Center. The main notebook (`LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb`) processes the raw detector strain data, applies signal filtering and windowing, and visualizes the detected waveform using functions from the `ligotools` module.


_This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Fall 2025 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science](https://ucb-stat-159-f25.github.io/site/). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration._
